# Snake Game AI using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains code for snake game, and an AI which learns to play the game using Deep Q Learning

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Pytorch 
- NumPy
- pygame
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AbtgCoder/Snake-RL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

   ```

3. Run the Agent:
   - Run the `agent.py` script to run the game, and start the learning of the q-agent.
   ```shell
   python agent.py
   ```
